                Train your brain with this memory card game. There are two identical images on the game board. Start the game by flipping a card. Then try to find another card that has the same image as the first. If you can't find a pair, the flipped cards will be flipped back with the face down. Try to remember these images as it becomes easier to find pairs the longer you play! 
The timer can be useful for measuring your progress, or you can just have fun and completely ignore it.
